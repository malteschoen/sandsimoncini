## historical documentation
* To be completed later, for the time being, here's a [link](http://www.sandsmachine.com/a_sim_r1.htm) to the existing documentation of the frame on the website of the manufacturer of the couplings.
* In September of 2024, I purchased the frame from a guy who said he'd bought in Italy(?) from a widow (?). 

## Plans
* Pick suitable group-set (or at least parts of it)
* If necessary, find suitable crank & casette
* Find suitable wheels
* Buy a handlebar kit
* Buy tubes & tyres
* Buy rim brakes
* Install everything

## Parts
### Wireless brifters
* WHEELTOP EDS-TX
* SRAM Rival eTap AXS
* Shimano and LTWOO are not in the pool since they require some internal cabling...
