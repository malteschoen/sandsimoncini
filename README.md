# historical documentation
* To be completed later, for the time being, here's a [link](http://www.sandsmachine.com/a_sim_r1.htm) to the existing documentation of the frame on the website of the manufacturer of the couplings.
* In September of 2024, I purchased the frame from a guy who said he'd bought in Italy(?) from a widow (?).

## Homemade blips:

#### Tooling
- Electric drill
- File
- Soldering iron
- Solder
- Flux
- Hot air gun (simple gas lighter will also do)
- Heat shrink tubing of XYZ mm diam (XYY thou)

#### Components per blip:
- [1x membrane keyboard. Note the Dupont-style receptacles.](https://www.reichelt.de/de/de/shop/produkt/entwicklerboards_-_folientastatur_1x_1_ziffer-266086?q=%2Fentwicklerboards-folientastatur-1x-1-ziffer-debo-tast-1x1-p266086.html)
- [1x barrel connector EIAJ-01 JEITA RC-5320A JSAP1](https://www.reichelt.de/de/de/shop/produkt/hohlstecker_mit_gewinde_aussen_2_5_mm_innen_0_7_mm-202895)
- [2x Dupont cables with at least one prong](https://www.mattmillman.com/info/crimpconnectors/dupont-and-dupont-connectors/)

#### Preparations
- Grab barrel connector jack  with the three teeth of the Jacobs-style chuck that is found on your electric drill
- Push file against spinning connector body to reduce body diameter to XYZ mm (XYZ thou).
- Cut and strip Dupont cables. Use soldering iron to coat exposed wire in solder (do not forget to apply flux first)
- Solder a cable to each metal tab of the barrel connector (again, remember to use flux)
- Apply heat shrink tubing
